# Execution Directory

The Execution directory is responsible for handling live trades and communication with brokerage APIs. This module ensures that trade orders are correctly formatted, validated, and executed.

## Contents
- API integration scripts for connecting to trading platforms.
- Trade validation and formatting functions to ensure correct order placement.

## Guidelines
1. Use error handling to manage API failures or delays.
2. Test execution scripts in a sandbox environment before deploying to live trading.
3. Log all trade activities to provide a clear audit trail.
