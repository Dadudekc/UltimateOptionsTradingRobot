# High-Frequency Trading Module

This directory contains code specifically designed for high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies. These modules are optimized for low latency and rapid execution.

## Contents
- HFT algorithms and implementations for fast trade execution.
- Tools for monitoring and optimizing HFT performance.

## Guidelines
1. Prioritize speed in all HFT modules, minimizing latency wherever possible.
2. Implement robust logging for performance tracking and error identification.
3. Ensure compatibility with the systemâ€™s order routing and risk management components.
