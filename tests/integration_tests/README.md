# Integration Tests Directory

This directory houses integration tests that check how well different parts of the system work together. These tests simulate real-world use cases to ensure smooth interactions between modules.

## Contents
- Tests that combine multiple modules or functions to simulate actual workflows.
- Mock environments for testing interactions without affecting live systems.

## Guidelines
1. Test each major workflow to confirm that modules work as expected when combined.
2. Implement mock environments to simulate external services (e.g., APIs).
3. Log results to easily identify any module incompatibility or failure points.
