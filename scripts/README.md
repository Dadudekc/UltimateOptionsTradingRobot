# Scripts Directory

The Scripts directory holds standalone scripts that execute specific functions, such as launching the bot, preprocessing data, updating data sources, or generating reports.

## Contents
- `launch_bot.py`: Script to initialize and run the TradingRobotPlug bot.
- `data_preprocessor.py`: Script to preprocess data before feeding it into models.
- `update_data_sources.py`: Script to refresh data by fetching the latest information from sources.
- `generate_reports.py`: Script for generating analytical reports.

## Guidelines
1. Organize scripts by functionality to facilitate quick navigation and usage.
2. Ensure each script has clear, modular functions that can be reused within the project if needed.
3. Document each scriptâ€™s purpose and parameters to make it easy for other contributors to use or modify.
