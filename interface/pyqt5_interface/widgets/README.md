# PyQt5 Widgets Directory

The Widgets directory holds custom widget components for the PyQt5 interface. Each widget corresponds to a specific feature or view within the TradingRobotPlug GUI.

## Contents
- `dashboard_widget.py`: Displays key trading metrics and system status.
- `portfolio_widget.py`: Shows portfolio composition and performance.
- `strategy_widget.py`: Allows users to configure and monitor trading strategies.
- `settings_widget.py`: Contains adjustable settings for user preferences.

## Guidelines
1. Keep each widget in a separate file to maintain modularity.
2. Use clear labels and tooltips within each widget to improve user experience.
3. Ensure widgets are compatible with the main PyQt5 window and consistent with the applicationâ€™s theme.
