# PyQt5 Dialogs Directory

The Dialogs directory contains dialog windows for the TradingRobotPlug GUI, used for user input, settings adjustments, and detailed performance views.

## Contents
- `settings_dialog.py`: Dialog for adjusting application settings.
- `strategy_dialog.py`: Dialog for configuring and fine-tuning trading strategies.
- `performance_dialog.py`: Displays detailed performance metrics and visualizations.

## Guidelines
1. Implement dialogs as pop-up windows to keep the main interface clean.
2. Allow configuration options in settings dialogs to be easily accessible and editable.
3. Maintain a consistent style with other interface components for a cohesive look and feel.
