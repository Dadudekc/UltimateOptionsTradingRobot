# Latency Optimization

This directory contains tools and techniques aimed at minimizing latency within the trading system, particularly for high-frequency trading and time-sensitive operations.

## Contents
- Scripts and libraries for monitoring and optimizing system latency.
- Code for profiling and optimizing network, API, and processing latencies.

## Guidelines
1. Regularly measure and log latency metrics across key system functions.
2. Optimize network connections and prioritize low-latency paths.
3. Implement fallbacks in case of unexpected latency spikes to maintain system stability.
