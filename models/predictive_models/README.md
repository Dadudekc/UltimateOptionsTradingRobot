# Predictive Models Directory

This directory holds predictive models, each designed to forecast specific aspects of the market. These models range from simpler algorithms to complex neural networks.

## Contents
- `lstm_model.py`: Long Short-Term Memory model for time-series predictions.
- `transformer_model.py`: Transformer-based model for advanced sequence predictions.
- `svm_model.py`: Support Vector Machine model for classification tasks.
- `random_forest_model.py`: Ensemble model for robust predictions.

## Guidelines
1. Clearly document model architecture and any dependencies required for training and usage.
2. Save trained models and associated metadata for easy reuse and deployment.
3. Include parameter tuning recommendations where applicable to enhance model performance.
