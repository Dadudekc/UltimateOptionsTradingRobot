# Tests Directory

The Tests directory organizes all testing scripts to ensure the reliability and functionality of the TradingRobotPlug system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.

## Structure
- `unit_tests/`: Scripts for testing individual functions or classes.
- `integration_tests/`: Scripts for testing interactions between different modules.
- `performance_tests/`: Scripts for testing the systemâ€™s performance under different conditions.

## Guidelines
1. Follow test-driven development (TDD) principles to create reliable, modular code.
2. Use mock data and controlled environments to simulate real-world conditions without external dependencies.
3. Ensure that test scripts are organized and labeled clearly for easy identification.
