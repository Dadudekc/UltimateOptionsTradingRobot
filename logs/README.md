# Logs Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing logs, organized by log type. Logs can capture information on trading activities, data processing, errors, and optimization processes.

## Structure
- `trade_logs/`: Logs for all trade-related actions.
- `data_logs/`: Logs detailing data fetching, processing, and updates.
- `error_logs/`: Stores error messages and traceback information for troubleshooting.
- `optimization_logs/`: Logs related to optimization activities, including parameter tuning and model improvement processes.

## Guidelines
1. Use consistent logging formats to ensure all log files are easily readable and searchable.
2. Separate log files by date for easy access and management.
3. Consider implementing automatic log rotation to prevent files from becoming too large.
