# Simulation Directory

The Simulation directory contains scripts and tools for running simulations and backtesting trading strategies. This allows for evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies in a controlled environment.

## Contents
- Simulation scripts that replicate market conditions and simulate trades.
- Strategy testing tools for analyzing model performance over historical data.

## Guidelines
1. Document each simulation scenario, including assumptions and parameters, for consistent testing.
2. Regularly update simulations to match real-world market conditions for accurate backtesting.
