# Genetic Algorithms Directory

This directory contains scripts for genetic algorithm-based optimization techniques used to refine trading strategies and model parameters.

## Contents
- Genetic algorithm modules for optimizing strategy parameters.
- Configurations for tuning evolutionary parameters like mutation rate and selection pressure.

## Guidelines
1. Keep genetic algorithm configurations flexible for easy tuning and experimentation.
2. Log results from each iteration to track optimization progress.
3. Include options for adjusting evolutionary parameters to control optimization behavior.
