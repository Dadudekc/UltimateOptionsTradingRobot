# Unit Tests Directory

The Unit Tests directory contains tests for individual functions and components in isolation, ensuring that each piece of code works correctly on its own.

## Contents
- Test scripts for core functions, utility modules, and critical calculations.
- Mock data for testing functions without external dependencies.

## Guidelines
1. Follow a consistent naming convention for all unit tests.
2. Aim for high coverage of critical functions and core utilities.
3. Regularly review and update tests to cover new functionality as itâ€™s added.
