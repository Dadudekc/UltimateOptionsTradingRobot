# Optimization Directory

The Optimization directory includes scripts and tools focused on parameter tuning and improving the performance of the TradingRobotPlug models and strategies.

## Contents
- Parameter optimization scripts for refining model and strategy parameters.
- Tools for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or genetic algorithms.

## Guidelines
1. Document optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms or hyperparameter tuning, used within each script.
2. Store results in structured formats to track and reproduce optimized settings.
3. Include configurable options for each optimization method to enhance flexibility.
