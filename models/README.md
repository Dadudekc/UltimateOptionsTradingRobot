# Models Directory

The Models directory contains all machine learning and reinforcement learning models developed for the TradingRobotPlug project. This includes model files, training scripts, and helper functions.

## Structure
- `predictive_models/`: Houses predictive models designed to forecast market trends.
- `reinforcement_learning/`: Contains models that learn and adapt through reinforcement learning techniques.

## Guidelines
1. Each model file should include information on its architecture, training parameters, and performance metrics.
2. Store model checkpoints and final trained models in organized folders for easy retrieval.
