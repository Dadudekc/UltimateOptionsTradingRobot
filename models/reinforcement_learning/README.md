# Reinforcement Learning Directory

This directory contains reinforcement learning models aimed at developing agents that learn and adapt to market dynamics through trial and error.

## Contents
- `dqn_agent.py`: Deep Q-Network agent for learning trading strategies.
- `policy_network.py`: Defines the policy network used by agents for decision-making.
- `reward_engine.py`: Calculates rewards for reinforcement learning agents.

## Guidelines
1. Define clear reward structures aligned with the projectâ€™s trading goals.
2. Use modular designs to facilitate experimentation with different reinforcement learning techniques.
3. Save agent configurations, including hyperparameters and training checkpoints, for reproducibility.
