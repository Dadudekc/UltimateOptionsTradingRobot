# Performance Tests Directory

The Performance Tests directory includes tests to evaluate the systemâ€™s speed, efficiency, and scalability. These tests are particularly important for high-frequency trading and data processing.

## Contents
- Benchmarks to measure execution time and latency across various modules.
- Stress tests to evaluate system behavior under heavy load conditions.

## Guidelines
1. Set clear performance benchmarks for critical modules.
2. Run regular performance tests to identify any areas needing optimization.
3. Document all test conditions and results for tracking performance improvements over time.
